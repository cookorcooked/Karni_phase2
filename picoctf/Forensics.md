Decode this message from the moon.

HINT : How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth?

## Solution:

Googling what the hint says "How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth?", gives us the answer that SSTV (Slow Scan Television) telecasts were used to send videos back to Earth.
Wikepedia (I realize it's not a super reliable source) confirms this.

Using an online SSTV Decoder gives us an image containing the flag.

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt about SSTV and other types of long distance transmissions 

## Notes:

- I'm so glad I looked up the hint cause I never would've gussed SSTV.
