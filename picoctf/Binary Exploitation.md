# 1. buffer overflow 0

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. Connect using: nc saturn.picoctf.net 58311

## Solution:

Looking at the code you can figure out that the sigsegv_handler fuction gives the flag, the gets command is being used which is susceptible to buffer overflow as it does perform bounds checking. So all we need to do is enter an input larger than the size of the variable to get the flag.

    cookorcooked@ubuntu25:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 58311
    Input: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}

# 2. Format String 0

Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy? Download the binary here. Download the source here. Connect with the challenge instance here: nc mimas.picoctf.net 60067

## Solution:

We are supposed to look for format specifiers to get a different output than expected, for customer one, we choose "Gr%114d_Cheese" as it has the format specifier %114d.

For the second customer we choose "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak" which has a format specifier %s which should give a srting. This gives us our flag

        cookorcooked@ubuntu25:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 60067
