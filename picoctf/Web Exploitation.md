# 3. Cookies

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

At the home page of the website, we are given a prompt to enter different kinds of cookies, since "snickerdoodle" is hinted at us, I type it and it takes us to a different page.

Looking at the cookies of the site, there exists only one cookie called "name", whose value is -1 at the home page and 0 on the page where snickerdoodle is entered.

Seeing this, I try and change the value of the cookie and refresh the page, this gives us different pages with different kinds of cookies. For the value 18, we get the flag.
