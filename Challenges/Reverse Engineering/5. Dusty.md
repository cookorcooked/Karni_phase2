## Solution:

The main function doesn't have much other than setting up Rust and then goes to the actual block of code that is in shinyclean::main()

The shinyclean::main() fucntion declares two arrays of size 23, and fills one of them with hard coded data.
There is a loop that just XORs the first array's data and stores it into the other array.

The flag can be found by just decoding these XOR operations.

I wrote a python script to do this,

```
data = [
    0x7b, 0x5e, 0x48, 0x58, 0x7c, 0x6b, 0x79, 0x44,
    0x79, 0x6d, 0x0c, 0x0c, 0x60, 0x7c, 0x0b, 0x6d,
    0x60, 0x68, 0x0b, 0x0a, 0x77, 0x1e, 0x42
]

decoded = "".join(chr(b ^ 0x3f) for b in data)
print(decoded)
```

Executing this script gives me the flag.

## Flag:

```
DawgCTF{FR33_C4R_W45H!}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt the basics of how Rust works and how it's pseudo code looks in ghidra.
- Learnt how to reverse a XOR using very basic python.
