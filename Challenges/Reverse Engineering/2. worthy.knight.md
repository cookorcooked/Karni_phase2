## Solution: 

We use ghidra and see that the entry function is primarily just calling the function FUN_001010d0.

Looking further at FUN_001010d0, we can clearly see that the input needs to be of 10 characters.

There is a loop that checks the input characters in pairs, the loop also makes sure the characters are all alphabetic using `` and that both both alphabets are of the opposite case using ``

Ater this we can start building the right input since for each pair, one of the alphabets is given and the other alphabet can be found using XOR.

For example for the first pair -

We can observe that the second character is `0x6a` which is `j` and the first character must satifsy `` which can be found using `` which gives us the first character to be `N`.
The first pair is `Nj` similarly we can find pairs 2, 4 and 5.

To find pair 3,

We can 

## Flag:

```
sunshine{C3A5ER_CR055ED_TH3_RUB1C0N}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt how to navigate decompiled code in Ghidra.
- Learnt how to reverse operations on a flag.
